1. Problem Statement

People who love movies and anime often have to jump between multiple platforms, torrent sites, or unofficial sources. This leads to fragmented experiences, outdated information, and no social interaction while watching. Existing streaming services donâ€™t combine movies + anime + social watch parties in one place.

2. Proposed Solution / Idea

Build a unified streaming web app where users can:

Watch movies and anime in one platform.

Get updates on newly released and upcoming titles.

Create/join watch parties to watch together with friends in real-time (synchronized playback + chat/voice).

Explore trending titles with personalized recommendations.

3. Key Features

Content Hub (Movies + Anime in one place)

Release Updates (notifications for new & upcoming titles)

Watch Party Mode (sync video playback, chat/voice, reactions)

Search & Filters (genre, release year, language, rating)

User Profiles (watchlist, history, favorites)

Community Features (ratings, reviews, comments)

(Optional Advanced): AI-based recommendations

4. Target Users / Audience

Anime & movie enthusiasts who want a single platform.

Groups of friends who want to watch content together virtually.

College students, community groups, and families.

Fans who want regular updates on new releases.

5. Technology Stack

Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind, React Router

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io (for watch parties)

Database: MongoDB + Mongoose

Streaming: Video hosting (Cloudflare Stream / AWS S3 + HLS)

Auth: JWT, bcrypt

Real-time: Socket.io for chat & sync playback

Hosting: Vercel (FE), Render/Heroku (BE), MongoDB Atlas

6. Expected Outcome

A streaming web app where:

Users can watch movies + anime seamlessly in one place.

Receive real-time updates on new & upcoming releases.

Watch together with friends via synchronized playback & chat/voice.

Build a community-driven platform with reviews, ratings, and recommendations.
