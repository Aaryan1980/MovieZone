Real-Time Event Booking & Management System
1. Problem Statement
Event organizers (colleges, communities, gyms) often manage registrations with spreadsheets or static forms. This causes double-bookings, no real-time seat visibility, messy cancellations, and poor attendee communication. A real-time solution with payments and role-based control is needed.

2. Proposed Solution / Idea
Build a MERN web app where Organizers create paid/free events with capacities, and Attendees book seats in real time. The app shows live seat availability (via Socket.io), supports secure online payments (Stripe), and sends email confirmations. Organizers get a dashboard for bookings, revenue, and waitlists.

3. Key Features
Role-based Auth (Organizer, Attendee)
Event CRUD (title, date/time, venue, capacity, price, category)
Real-time seat availability with Socket.io
Secure payments via Stripe (Payment Intents)
Booking management (confirm, cancel, waitlist)
Email confirmations (Nodemailer) (optional for MVP)
Search & filters (date, price, category, location)
Organizer dashboard (bookings, revenue)
4. Target Users / Audience
College fest teams & clubs
Workshop/seminar organizers
Local classes (yoga, dance, sports)
Community & cultural events
5. Technology Stack
Frontend: React (Vite), React Router, Tailwind (optional)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io
Database: MongoDB + Mongoose
Payments: Stripe
Auth: JWT, bcrypt
Email (optional): Nodemailer
Hosting: Vercel (FE), Render/Fly/Heroku (BE), MongoDB Atlas
6. Expected Outcome
A production-grade MVP where:

Attendees can book/cancel seats and pay online.
Organizers see live capacity, manage bookings, and view revenue.
The system prevents overbooking with server-side checks and real-time locks.
